AC: AC-6
result: pass
commands: Read spec/requirements/REQ-009.md; git show 5e21fcc:frontend/e2e/navigation.spec.ts, frontend/src/router/nav.js, frontend/e2e/pages/nav.page.ts; gh run view 36975668019 --job 110738843955 --log; gh run view 36975668019 --json headSha,conclusion,status
observed: CI run 36975668019 job frontend (headSha 5e21fcc, success): vitest "Tests 13 passed (13)"; Playwright "30 passed (28.5s)" on projects mobile-390 and desktop-1280; real API behind the proxy returned {"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}. Labels compared character for character with REQ-009. Alerts: Active, History, Notification settings identical; passed on both projects.
attack: Ambiguity with Home's Active strategies ruled out by anchored ^Active$ after opening the section; Notification settings vs account Notifications asserted separately. No mutation run (the verifier cannot edit); ac_fp supplied by the orchestrator (kit guard blocks the verifier's tools/ run).

Recorded by the orchestrator from the verifier's returned block.
